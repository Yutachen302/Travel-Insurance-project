# Travel-Insurance-project
A statistical assessment was conducted by Rstudio to evaluate the likelihood of whether the travelers purchase the travel insurance, and find insights to help the insurance company's marketing strategy. Multiple machine learning models are included such as Logistic regression, Random forest, and Decision tree to identify the features that contribute to travel insurance purchased. Lastly, summarize and visualize the findings with the suggestion for marketing strategy, and define the potential customer.
